Place the cakephp project folder (uow_fyp_spmr_sys) inside htdocs and point the webroot to that project folder in xampp's config.
Import the database file (uow_fyp_spmr_sys.sql) into phpmyadmin.

When running the project, ensure that the database connection username and password is correct, which can be added in phpmyadmin's list of users.
If the username and password for database connection is incorrect, it can be configured in cakephp project folder (uow_fyp_spmr_sys/config/app.php).
Find datasource and edit the username and password there.
